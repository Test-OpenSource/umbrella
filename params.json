Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. \r\n\r\n### Architecture of XXXXX\r\nThe XXXXX project is made of the following parts:\r\n\r\n- sub project 1:\r\n\r\n    This part is ... See [the project page](https://github.com/Test-OpenSource/test)\r\n\r\n- sub project 2:\r\n\r\n    This part is ...\r\n    \r\n- sub project 3:\r\n\r\n    This part is ...\r\n\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use.\r\n\r\n### How to contribute\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Discuss and contact us\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
